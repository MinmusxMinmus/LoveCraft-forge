# LoveCraft

Minecraft mod that aims to recreate H.P. Lovecraft's horror stories.

## Features

Plans for the mod include:

- An alternate dimension accessible only by sleeping, representing Randolph Carter's dream world
- A new dimension beneath the Overworld, representing the deep caverns mentioned in *At the Mountains of Madness* and *The shadow over Innsmouth*
- A research/progression system based on translating ancient tomes written in incomprehensible languages
- A new infectious biome based on the affliction described in *The colour out of space*
- Multiple, unique research paths that allow the player to focus on the parts of the Lovecraftian universe they're most interested in
- And much more!

## Details

Currently, the mod is being developed for Minecraft Forge 1.12.2 only. As the mod progresses, there are plans to port it to 1.16.5, as well as a potential Fabric version.

## Usage

You can use the mod in your modpack, as long as you download it from official sources (here, or at the Forge page). This isn't necessary, but let me know if your modpack has this mod so I can check it out.

## License

This mod uses the GNU GPLv3 license. The complete license is available [here](LICENSE.txt). It is encouraged to read through the entire license, but here is a short version detailing what's probably most relevant for you:

> If you want to use the code, you must use the same license (this one). Your code must also be open source, and include a link to the original code (this repository). You must state significant changes made to the original code, and include your own copy of the GNU GPL license somewhere in the code/repository.

Also, if you make your own version of the mod, let me know because I'd love to see it.
